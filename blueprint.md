# Blog Application Blueprint

## Overview

This is a simple blog application built with React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to view a list of blog posts, click on a post to view its details, and add comments to a post.

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains the React components used in the application.
- `src/pages`: Contains the page components for each route.
- `src/data`: Contains the JSON data for the blog posts and comments.
- `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that sets up the routing.
- `src/index.css`: The main stylesheet for the application.
- `tailwind.config.js`: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS.
- `postcss.config.js`: The configuration file for PostCSS.

## Features

- **Commenting**: Users can add comments to a blog post.
- **Routing**: The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing.
